        <p><span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">Life expectancy</span> is the average number of years a 
        person or population is expected to live and is a crucial metric 
        for assessing <span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">overall health and well-being</span>. It's influenced by 
        factors like healthcare access, socioeconomic status, genetics, 
        lifestyle choices, and public health measures. Improvements in these 
        areas have contributed to increased life expectancies in many regions, 
        highlighting the significance of 
        addressing these determinants for <span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">healthier and longer lives</span>. </p>

        <p><span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">Life expectancy</span> varies significantly among countries, 
          with the highest recorded at around 85 years and the 
          lowest at approximately 50 years. The map illustrates a 
          gradual <span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">increase in life expectancy</span> from 2000 to 2015. 
          Despite this upward trend, Africa has consistently displayed the 
          lowest life expectancy among continents due to a combination of 
          factors such as prevalent infectious diseases, limited healthcare access, 
          and socio-economic hurdles. Within Asia, Japan stands out with the highest 
          life expectancy. However, regions in <span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">America and Europe</span> 
          surpass these figures with notably higher life expectancies. <p>

          <p>Now, let's take a closer look at <span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">life expectancy</span> by 
            comparing it across continents. The bar chart reveals 
            that, from 2000 to 2015,<span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">most continents exceed the mean 
              life expectancy</span> value which is at around 70 years, except for Africa. Consequently, 
            WHO needs to prioritize targeted interventions in African 
            regions to address the disparities.
            Additionally, these disparities in life expectancy emphasize the importance 
            of addressing healthcare accessibility, socio-economic development, and 
            disease prevention in African nations. By focusing on these key areas, we 
            can work towards reducing the gaps in life expectancy and improving the well-being 
            of populations across the continent.

            <span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">Europe consistently maintains the top position</span> throughout 
            the years, with North America and South America following 
            closely in second and third place. However, it's noteworthy 
            that North and South America occasionally swap their rankings 
            during this period. Unfortunately, Africa consistently holds the 
            lowest position from 2000 to 2015. In conclusion, Europe has the
            highest life expectancy, while africa has the lowest
            life expectancy compare to other continents throughout the year.

            health by preventing a range of life-threatening diseases and severe 
            health complications. Higher immunization rates among children not only
             curtail the transmission of these diseases within the population but
